        #### PLEASE NOTE
        We do not support isssues related to running versions from GitHub mixed with versions from the Factorio mod portal.

        Please post all details in **English**.

        #### Prerequisites before submitting an issue!
        - Check the **[frequent/common issues list](https://github.com/pyanodon/pybugreports/issues/1)** and perform a **[search of submitted issues (including closed ones)](https://github.com/search?q=user%3Apyanodon&type=issues)** to avoid posting a duplicate.
        - Make sure this is not a support request or question, both of which are better suited for either the **[discussions section](https://github.com/pyanodon/pybugreports/discussions)** or **[discord](https://discord.gg/PtDdRtYZrx)**.
        - Verify that you can reproduce the issue with the **absolute minimum set of mods** (including any required to cause the issue, but no more).
        - Do you have programming experience? Consider instead submitting a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) to help reduce our workload.
        - **Always** include the factorio-current.log file. Additionally, if relevant to issue/when asked, please provide a savegame & screenshots.
